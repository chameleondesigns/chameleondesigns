- 👋 Hi, I’m @chameleondesigns
- 👀 I’m interested in ...Hello, I am a freelance web designer/developer and the owner of Chameleon Web Designs.

As a busy stay at home mum of four, two being special needs, I wasn't sure when I would be able to re-enter the workforce. 
That was until someone suggested I look at opening an online dropshipping store. After completely setting up a website using the Shopify platform, I was inspired. 
I had really enjoyed giving myself something to focus on and keep myself thinking.

So, I created a couple more websites with Wix just for fun, now a few websites in I was excited and eager to expand, but running an online store which was 
already set up didn't appeal to me, and I was more interested in the design and creation side of the website's.

That's when I decided to look into teaching myself, with the help of online tools, how to use Adobe Illustrator for creating logos etc. I was hooked! 
A few sleepless nights and a dust off of the "critical thinking" section of my brain, I'd jumped in to Figma, and then HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

With a working history, albeit near ancient (13 years ago), in Business Administration, a knack for picking up a new software package with ease, 
and a self-confessed artistic flare, I knew I could re-join the workforce by offering my time to others, in a way that enabled me to also focus on my family.
